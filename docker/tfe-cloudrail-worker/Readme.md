# Building you own Terraform Alternative Worker


## Docker file

The Dockerfile includes the common instructions to build a [Terraform Alternative Worker](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/install/installer.html#alternative-terraform-worker-image) and the requirements to install Cloudrail CLI.
